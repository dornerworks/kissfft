This repo exists to demonstrate the benefits and ease of use of SSE and AVX extensions added to Mark Borgerding's KISS FFT library.

This does NOT utilize the USE_SIMD compiler option already included in KISS FFT. That offers SSE support to the floating point implementation. This uses SSE and AVX modification to support the fixed point implementation.

These modifications were developed by Stewart Hildebrand, Anthony Boorsma, and Kevin Kredit of DornerWorks Ltd. Visit https://dornerworks.com/ and https://dornerworks.com/about/blog/ [TODO link to blog post] to learn more about the company and writing vectorized code.
